        "This place is well worth the visit and make sure to book your all inclusive ticket well in advance, which will let you skip with waiting lines, and will also give you access to the Roman Forum.

            I would definitely allow yourself at least a couple of hours to walk around the Forum as it is such a vast space with lots to see and do. Your all access tickets will allow you to see the exhibitions inside too.

            As for the Colosseum, what an incredible piece of history. Words cannot describe how stunning this structure is. Definitely a highlight of our trip in Rome.",

        "As a lover of history, I can't recommend visiting enough. It's absolutely breathtaking. Pictures can't do justice to the scale and beauty of this monument. Highly recommend booking a tour in advance to skip the queues and to learn so much more about the place. It is completely worth doing the underground also.",
    
        "The restoration and landscaping of the Colosseum have been done very well. It manages to shine from the moment you see it until the last glance you take as you leave. I recommend buying tickets online due to the crowds. Be sure to pay attention to the timing when selecting your online tickets and be there at the specified time, or else you won't be able to enter.

            The organization of the entrance area was very poor. Unfortunately, I find the ticket prices to be quite expensive, and I don't think the regular ticket meets expectations. We bought tickets that also provided access to the Arena, Underground, and III Level of the Colosseum with a guide. It was really expensive, and although we were generally satisfied with our visit, I don't think it was worth the money we spent."
