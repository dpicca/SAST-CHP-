From the moment I approached the Colosseum, I was struck by its imposing presence and the sheer scale of its structure. Standing in the heart of Rome, it's a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the ancient Roman civilization. As I entered the Colosseum and explored its interior, I was fascinated by the intricate details of its design and the engineering marvels that allowed it to accommodate tens of thousands of spectators. The tiers of seating, the underground chambers where gladiators awaited their fate, and the arena itself all spoke volumes about the cultural and social significance of this remarkable amphitheater. While walking through the corridors and archways of the Colosseum, I couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence for the history that unfolded within these walls. Imagining the roar of the crowds, the clash of swords, and the bravery of the gladiators added depth to my visit and made me appreciate the Colosseum even more. Moreover, the Colosseum offers breathtaking views of the surrounding area, including the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, which further enriched my experience. It's a place where history comes alive, and every corner tells a story of ancient Rome's power, glory, and legacy. In addition to its historical significance, the Colosseum is also a symbol of resilience and endurance. Despite centuries of wear and tear, it still stands as a testament to human achievement and the enduring spirit of Rome. Overall, visiting the Colosseum was a highlight of my trip to Rome, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply experiencing the awe-inspiring wonders of the ancient world. It's a place that truly captures the imagination and leaves a lasting impression on all who visit."}, {"contributor_id": "106284459198853176246", "iso_date": "2024-05-07T06:57:24Z", "rating": 5.0, "likes": 1, "text": "*Probably the number 1 reason for everyone trip to Rome, it can be most famous place in the world. *The largest surviving amphitheater in the world *In addition to gladiatorial battles, ship battles were also held by filling the amphitheater floor with 1.5 / 1.8 meters of water. *The maximum capacity of amphitheater could reach up to 70 thousands and it was free entrance for all roman empire citizens but seating arrangement according to classes."}, {"contributor_id": "112343190222439466115", "iso_date": "2024-04-06T07:44:04Z", "rating": 5.0, "likes": 5, "text": "What a place! This is a must when in Rome, I could have stayed here all day just looking at it. The history  behind it is fascinating. A warning for those with children, you will need ID for them. We were able to use a photo of their passports as we didn't have the originals with us. It is very busy - we visited in March and the queues were huge, so it must be worse in the summer months. We pre-booked a 'skip the line' guided tour, so we were able to skip the huge lines. I would highly recommend booking through one of the many guided tour providers (we used Show Me Italy,  booked through Trip Advisor). I would also recommend booking to visit the arena floor, as this isn't included in the standard admission.

However, it's essential to be prepared for the massive queues, particularly after 9-10 am. To fully appreciate this iconic landmark, allocate a minimum of two hours for your visit. Despite the lengthy wait times, once inside, you'll be awestruck by the magnificence of this ancient amphitheater. The atmosphere is palpable as you walk through the corridors where gladiators once roamed, imagining the spectacles that unfolded in this historic arena. While the queues may test your patience, the opportunity to explore the Colosseum is well worth the wait, offering a glimpse into the fascinating past of ancient Rome. ** Tip: Buy your tickets at: https://www.coopculture.it/en/products/ticket-colosseum-roman-forum-palatine_24h/ to avoid Queues"}, {"contributor_id": "114081442237049242049", "iso_date": "2024-04-29T08:15:57Z", "rating": 5.0, "likes": 2, "text": "Long wait in there but the surroundings are also beautiful.

It was definitely crowded and touristy, but it's one of the few ruined buildings you can still step inside and walk into the same spaces as the ancient Romans.

It manages to shine from the moment you see it until the last glance you take as you leave. I recommend buying tickets online due to the crowds. Be sure to pay attention to the timing when selecting your online tickets and be there at the specified time, or else you won't be able to enter. The organization of the entrance area was very poor. Unfortunately, I find the ticket prices to be quite expensive, and I don't think the regular ticket meets expectations. We bought tickets that also provided access to the Arena, Underground, and III Level of the Colosseum with a guide. It was really expensive, and although we were generally satisfied with our visit, I don't think it was worth the money we spent. Additionally, when the tour started, the guide recommended installing an app on our phones. The guide's explanations and more were available on this app, allowing us to get more detailed information. Okay, it's nice to get information, but the problem is they charge so much money and don't even provide a printed, quality brochure!"}, {"contributor_id": "110837723748493082199", "iso_date": "2024-05-06T08:03:47Z", "rating": 5.0, "likes": 0, "text": "Beautiful.
